* ( Kisê )

a small and easy to use time keeping application

** ( about )

Kisê is a small and easy to use time keeping application.

It can be used in a single user mode or by small
organizations. Starting with version 0.9.4, it can import other user's
database, an essential feature for remote collaborators.

The fields it handles are: a date, who, for whom, what, a duration,
whether or not to be charged and a description.

It includes, on the main application screen, a powerful dynamic
filters criteria mechanism, which lets you visualize, work on and
print a subset of your time keeping entries.

A printing templates system allows you to (pre)define, reuse and hence
quickly generate the pdf files and/or printed reports of your needs.

A version which will let users export an active filter based subset of
their time keeping entries is under work.

*** ( latest news )

3 Mar 2014 Kisê version 0.9.4 is out, see NEWS.org for details.

** ( the name )

Kisê comes from the language Tupi-Guarani. It means 'an old and/or
rusty knife'. It should be pronounced ki-c. However, if you pronounce
it kee-c, it would come close to the french expression 'qui sait',
which means 'who knows'. Then comes why the name: 'qui sait? kisê!' -
'who knows? Kisê!'. Neat dont you think ? Finally, this kind of
application is (also) used to, in the end, produce invoices, quite a
pain, which could (too) well be caused by 'an old and/or rusty
knife'...

** ( what else )

Kisê is written in guile, an interpreter and compiler for the scheme
programming language. It uses guile-gnome for its graphical interface,
SQLite for its database backend and LaTeX for the reports.
