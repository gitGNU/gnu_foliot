@section About Kisê

Kisê is a small and easy to use time keeping application.  It can be used in a
single user mode or by small organizations.  The fields it handles are: a
@strong{reference}, a @strong{date}, @strong{who}, @strong{for whom},
@strong{what}, a @strong{duration}, whether or not the time keeping entry needs
@strong{to be charged} and a @strong{description}.  The reference is handled
automatically by Kisê and therefore is a @emph{read only} field.

A powerful dynamic filters criteria mechanism lets you visualize, work on and
print a subset of your time keeping entries.  Unlike most other similar
applications, this mechanism is available on Kisê's main application window.

A printing templates system allows you to (pre)define, reuse and hence quickly
generate the pdf files and/or printed reports of your needs.

An import/export facility is under work for remote collaboration.

@node Kisê, the name
@section Kisê, the name

Kisê comes from the language @emph{Tupi-Guarani}.  It means 'an old and/or rusty
knife'.  It should be pronounced @samp{ki-c}.  However, if you pronounce it
@samp{kee-c}, it would come close to the french expression 'qui sait?', which
means 'who knows?'.  Then comes why the name: 'qui sait? kisê!' - 'who knows?
Kisê!'.  Neat dont you think ? Finally, this kind of application is (also) used
to, in the end, produce invoices, quite a pain, which could (too) well be caused
by 'an old and/or rusty knife'...

@node What else
@section What else
Kisê is written in @uref{@value{UGUILE}, guile}, an interpreter and compiler for
the @uref{@value{USCHEME}, scheme} programming language.  It uses
@uref{@value{UGUILE-GNOME}, guile-gnome} for its graphical interface,
@uref{@value{USQLITE}, SQLite} for its database backend and
@uref{@value{ULATEX}, latex} for the reports.

@node Dependencies
@subsection Dependencies

Kisê needs the following software to run:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@uref{@value{UGUILE}, guile}>= 2.0.5
@item
@uref{@value{UGUILE-GNOME}, guile-gnome} >= 2.16.2
@item 
@uref{@value{USQLITE}, SQLite} >= 3.7
@item 
@uref{@value{USQLITE3-PCRE}, sqlite3-pcre}: perl compatible regular expression support for SQLite
@item
@uref{@value{ULATEX}, latex}: any recent latex 2e version will do
@end itemize

Kisê reports needs the following font:

@itemize @bullet
@item 
@uref{@value{UIWONA}, iwona}: on debian iwona is part of the texlive-fonts-extra package
@end itemize


@node Quickstart
@subsection Quickstart

Kisê can be obtained from the following archive site @uref{@value{UKISE-RELEASES}}.
The file will be named kise-version.tar.gz. The current version is
@value{VERSION}, so the file you should grab is:

@tie{}@tie{}@tie{}@tie{}@uref{@value{UKISE-LATEST}}

Kisê consists of a series of guile modules, some of which are common to several
applications. Consequently, the tarball contains two directories, named
@file{common} and @file{kise}.  Assuming you have satisfied the dependencies,
download the latest tarball, open a terminal and proceed with the following
steps@footnote{The directory of installation @file{/opt} and the name
@file{nongnu} are of course just examples.  Subsequently, replace
@code{'download-path'} as appropriate.  Finally, you probably want to add
@file{/opt/nongnu/kise} to the @env{PATH} variable of your default shell
configuration file as well.}:

@example
cd /opt
mkdir nongnu; cd nongnu
tar zxf 'download-path'/kise-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz
cd kise
ln -fs main.scm kise
@c @result{#f}
@end example

In addition, in order to compile and run Kisê, you need to inform guile where to
find all its necessary modules. There are several ways to do so, one of which is
by defining the variable @env{GUILE_LOAD_PATH}@footnote{if it is already
defined, use the following command instead: @code{export
GUILE_LOAD_PATH=$GUILE_LOAD_PATH:/opt/nongnu:/opt/nongnu/common}. you also
probably want to add [or modify] this definiton to [in] your default shell
configuration file.}:

@example
export GUILE_LOAD_PATH=/opt/nongnu:/opt/nongnu/common
./kise
@end example

Happy Kisê!
