@chapter Overview of @value{KISE}

@value{KISE} allows you to save timesheet.

The application window has five parts: a menu, a toolbar, the
timesheet entry, the list of entries and an information area.

For now, the menu is disabled.

The toolbar has ten buttons, they allow:

@itemize @bullet
@item
to connect to a database;

@item
to duplicate, add or delete a timesheet entry;

@item
to print;

@item
to go to the first, the previous, the next, the last record;

@item
to open preferences.

@end itemize

The fields are reference, date, who, for whom, what, duration (in
hours), to be charged and description. The combos (who, for whom and
what) are dynamic, they reflect the contents of the database but it is
possible to copy what we want.

The list of entries has two parts, the filter criteria and the list.

With the filter criteria, it's possible to filter entries in one or
more conditions, according to several operators.

The selection of a row of the list shows the detail in the timesheet
entry.

Finally, the information area gives the total time (in hours and
days), the charged times, the selected record and the number of
records (in accordance with the filter).

When an error occurs, a messsage will appear at the bottom right.

@section Filter criteria

To filter entries, type a few letters in a topic in the filter
criteria.

@node Printing dialog
@chapter Printing dialog

The printing dialog is very powerfull. You can choose to print in a
pdf file or with a printer.

You can define many templates. A template organises how and what to
print the entries. To create a new template, clic the + button and
change the name in the combo. To delete a template, clic the - button;
an alert asks you to confirm the delete. When there is only one
model, the - button is disabled.

You choose to print only the selected entry or all entries (= all
filtered entries).

You choose also items to print, group and sort.

When an item is grouped, a title will be printed with the content of
the item.

You can specify, for each item, whether it should be sorted in
ascending, descending or unsorted; select the appropriate option.

When you check the group box of an item, the print box is also
check. The item moves to the top

 When you clear a print box with group box
