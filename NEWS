GNU Foliot version 0.9.6-alpha is released.

Special Note: Before GNU Foliot became a GNU package, it was named Kisê.
The change of name has implied thousands of source code, manual and
web-pages changes.

The application is quite robust, with respect to the implemented
functionality as in version 0.9.5, but the huge quantity of source code
changes is, in itlself, error prone, hence an alpha release.

Here is a summary of the changes since version 0.9.5. See GNU Foliot's
git summary [1] and git log [2] for a complete description:

Core
----

	- known bugs have been fixed, see org/kise-bugs.org if your are
      interested;
	- automatic schema migration from kise -> foliot has been
      implemented; opening and re-importing dabatase(s) always trigger a
      schema check and upgrade automatically if necessary.

Because of the above, we strongly recommend you make a backup of your
database(s), if you were a Kisê user of course: you can never be too
prudent!

GUI
---

	- list-store duration now rendered as text: this is to paliate a
      gtk2 list store spin button rendering bug.

Printing
--------

	- printing dialog title label layout reviewed: all dialogs
      are now uniform in presentation.

Documentation
-------------

Note that the documentation is still a mock-up, but:

	- all reviewed for the new name of course, and sync with
      web-pages with repect to dependencies and installation procedure.

Web-pages
---------

	- GNU Foliot's web-pages have been entirely rewritten using sxml.
