Kisê version 0.9.5 is released.

	- Good news for everyone:
	- Kisê is now fully autotool chained;
	- it depends on Grip [prev. 'common'] also fully autotool
      chained;
	- both Kisê and Grip run strict dependency checks @ configure
      time;
	- both install compiled modules, shared among all users.
	- Other than that, known bugs have been fixed, see
      org/kise-bugs.org if your are interested, and:

Miscellaneous

	- all copyright years range updated;
	- org, pot, po and texi files now have copyright headers;
	- icons are now in svg not png;

Backend

	- Kisê's application script launcher code reviewed;
	- fixing things so Kisê works with Guile-2.2 [1];
	- database correctness/automatic update(s) control mechanism
      added;

GUI

	- fixing <gtk-spin-button> float values not honoring 1 decimal
      only [2].

Documentation

Note that the documentation is still a mock-up, but:

	- texi files fixed to compile against Texinfo >= 5.2;

Printing

	- rephrasing some of the draft summary output;
	- default draft report subsection and footskip vertical space
      review.

Web-pages

	- Kisê's web-pages  have been entirely rewritten  using sxml. As
      you will spot, they also now share their design, global procedures
      and css definitions with Grip's web-pages.


[1] note that Guile-2.2 has an unfixed GOOPS related bug [3] which, until
    solved, makes it impossible to run Kisê;

[2] we still need to fix this problem for the liststore;
